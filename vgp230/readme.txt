Points:
You get points by destroying meteors.
Bombs destroy everything on the screen awarding points based on how many you destroy.

You do not get points if a meteor hits you or reaches the end, instead you lose HP.

The game is endless, try to get as many points as possible.

Health:
You lose HP if a meteor hits you or succesfully reaches the bottom of your screen.
you have 100 HP and meteors deal 10 Damage

Waves:
A wave is 10 meteors long, each wave becomes more an more difficult as you progress.
The meteors gain speed and the time in between meteors becomes shorter

Debug:
The outside circle shows collison:
Red = colliding
Green = not colliding

The inside circle shows status:
Green = full HP
Yellow = half HP
Red = low HP


To Win:
I created a way to win the game if you wish to end it early,
after getting 10 points an power button will appear, if you collide with you will win.

PowerUps:
Cheese gives increased attack speed

Carrot gives increased movement speed
